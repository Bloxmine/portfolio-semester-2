# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and skills developed during the second semester.

## Features

JSON loader system built from scratch, loads in projects easily, including images and links.

## Set up

Pull the project and open _index.html_ in your web browser of choice.

## Notes

The Three.js globe requires a somewhat modern GPU. It has been tested to work on integrated Intel graphics from at least **2012** onwards, but it has shown not to work when trying to render on a 2009 nVidia GPU.

Otherwise the website should work in any modern browser, but has been tested in Chromium, Firefox and Safari. But most likely will work in any Blink, Gecko or Webkit based browser.
