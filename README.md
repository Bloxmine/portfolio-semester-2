# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and skills developed during the second semester.

## Features

1. JSON loader system built from scratch, loads in projects easily, including images and links.
2. Projects and buttons loaded in and able to be dynamically updated.

## Set up

Clone the repo and open _index.html_ in your web browser of choice.

## What this project consists of
The JSON loader is the heart of my website. (W.I.P)

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- GSAP (GreenShock Animation Platform)
- Marked.js
- Three.js (inc. OrbitalControls)

## Notes

The Three.js globe requires a somewhat modern GPU. It has been tested to work on integrated Intel graphics from at least **2012** onwards, but it has shown not to work when trying to render on a 2009 nVidia GPU.

Otherwise the website should work in any modern browser, but has been tested in Chromium, Firefox and Safari. But most likely will work in any Blink, Gecko or Webkit based browser.
