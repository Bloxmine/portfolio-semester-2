                </div><p>The entire <a href="../../projects/group/soundwave/brandguide/brandguide.html">brandguide</a> was made by me, based on the style we as a group chose based on feedback and surveys. It was important for me to remain consistent with the design within the brandguide. The look is very dark, with purple accents. That gives it a sort of ‘fancy night time’ look.</p>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>I’ve learned a lot on how to iterate what to take in. Some things didn’t go as planned at first, such as making the stylescape. But I also learned how to put all of my designs into Figma and the importance of just making and refining designs quickly. This allowed me to come up with so much more than if I had just focused on one design.</p>
                <h1>Fontys OVP</h1>
<h3>Context:</h3><p> It was important for the Fontys OVP website redesign that I iterated on the design based on feedback and testing.</p>

<p>For the Fontys OVP site I've made mockups of potential advertising as well as a mockup for the easter egg. I've also made a few different versions of the logo and the site design. I've also made a few different versions of the background and the UI.</p>


<h3>Design visual works:</h3><p> We studied the Fontys brand guide and I’ve made Instagram post mockups for attracting potential students. The use of triangles is encouraged in the branding. And I’ve also paid careful attention to the colours and fonts. </p>

<p>The Figma file was created by Louis and so we’ve used it as a starting point of our finalized design. The website was divided in sections in which each of us programmed made a different part of the main page. I made the basic layout as well as the easter egg and some of the middle parts.</p>

Initially it looked like this.</p><p>
This was refined into being a fully-fledged website, a potential replacement for the OVP site as well as being a replacement for the subpages. Contained all in one. The final design differs from the Figma file, the footer is different for example. This was done based on group discussion. The Figma concept was first demonstrated to our stakeholder in the first presentation, we received plenty of feedback that we iterated on.</p>
<h3>Feedback received on easter egg: </h3><p>
The easter egg was my main focus this project. Initially I did research [LOCATED IN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS]</p>

<p>Click on the image to see a gallery of the iterations and some explanation</p>

<p>
From the feedback we received during the user test we did with Penny [LINK TO LO1] I’ve set up plans in iterating on the site:</p>
<h3>Iteration 1:Focus on Click Reduction</h3>

<p><i>Context:</i> We conducted user testing with Penny, who had previously tested the original website. This allowed us to compare user experience across iterations.
Findings: Penny's initial interaction revealed a key issue: the information architecture required too many clicks to find relevant content, particularly testimonials from ex-students. These were located on the main page but lacked a clear title, leading to difficulty in discovery.</p>
<p><i>Action:</i> Based on this feedback, we prioritized information architecture in the redesign. We restructured the content to minimize clicks needed to find key information. For example, testimonials were given a prominent section with a clear title on the homepage.</p>

<h3>Iteration 2: Refining the Easter Egg</h3>

<p><i>Context:</i> While Penny appreciated the easter egg (Konami code interaction), she and other testers found it challenging to discover. Their attempts involved random clicks around the website, indicating a lack of intuitive discovery methods.
Findings: The easter egg's obscurity, while intended to be subtle, hindered its enjoyment for a broader audience.</p>
<p><i>Action:</i> We acknowledged the value of the easter egg for the target audience but recognized the need for refinement. Future iterations will explore ways to make the easter egg more discoverable, potentially through subtle hints or alternative triggers, while maintaining a clean user experience.</p>

<p>Thanks to the user test, I came up with an idea to add a small easter egg when pressing the Fontys logo on the top left of the page. This is one of the first areas which gets clicked on so to me it made sense to add a nod to the Konami code.
Now the player character from Contra walks past. Contra was the game the Konami code originated from.</p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3><p> This took quite a bit of work. Iterating on the design was </p>

<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h3>Context:</h3><p>  My portfolio has seen many different iterations. Starting from learning how to use Javascript better and making a few experiments for my site design, then receiving feedback and starting again but this time instead of beginning with programming an developing the design from there, I collected inspiration.</p>
<h3>Professional design tools:</h3><p> For my document I’ve used Affinity Publisher to create a custom layout and design. This allows me to do much more than I would’ve been able in Word. One part of the document is more of a mood board while other parts are more focused on text, but the text is able to be placed anywhere. </p>
<h3>Iteratively: </h3><p>
<b>Design:</b> The design of the portfolio has seen many differences. I originally wanted to use a more 2000’s Flash inspired website. But I received harsh feedback about the design. So I started thinking and iterating on new designs, which I’ve showcased in a design document. The site radically changed designs and from there I kept building on it until I was satisfied about the looks. However, the way the content was presented changed even more. From the feedback I received I changed how the learning outcomes are presented: </p>
<p>-	First version had every project I’ve worked on on one single page, the user could select an outcome and the projects relevant would be highlighted. This caused issues when having to add more explanation as multiple outcomes could be selected at the same time.</p><p>
-	Second version changed the way learining outcomes were display into categories. Every one of the five has a different tab. Once clicked you’ll see every project and explanations about how the learning outcome was explored and used.</p>
<p><b>Programming:</b> How I developed my website changed quite a bit. Based on the feedback received during the first portfolio review, I had scrap the current site and start over again and this time first designing and researching before actually coding. This resulted in a better manageable website but I also discussed with a few teachers whether or not to use some sort of JSON loading system. I decided on using it because it seemed better with large amounts of text, not having to touch code. However, I eventually found it to just be too much work once I wanted to change up the layout and add in images and galleries into the pages. So I went back to ‘hardcoding’ the page content into the HTML. This gave me a much better result but it did take some extra effort. I did learn how a JSON loader works and now have a better understanding of JSON file structure itself. So it wasn’t all for nothing.</p>

<h3>Design visual works:</h3><p> I showed a lot of iterations in my document and a lot of them have an explanation next to them as to why I chose the colours that I did. But also why I went with the mashup of styles. I enjoy a lot of different designs and my challenge was to be able to combine them into a satisfying result.</p>

<p>I documented this well into a custom PDF **Click here to see the PDF**<p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3><p> Initially I just messed around with Javascript, trying to learn new things and this quickly turned into a quite messy portfolio site. From the feedback I received in the first portfolio review I knew that I had to do it differently from now on. So instead of coding and then finding a suitable design, I would now do research and iterate on my designs. This helped me a lot in finding the right direction in which I wanted to take my portfolio.</p>
