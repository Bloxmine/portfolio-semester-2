                <p>During this semester I've discovered how I can more clearly iterate on my projects. These projects have seen quite a few iterations and without the feedback I've received, I wouldn't have had any decent results.</p>
                <h1>Soundwave Studio</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p>There have been many iterations of the Fontys Soundlab project. It was important to keep track of this in a collaborative file so we could compare our designs and see what every group member was doing. This was done in Figma and Word</p>
                <p><a href="/pdf/Soundlab.pdf">Click here to see the Word document</a>   |   <a href="/pdf/Figma.pdf">Click here to see the Figma file</a></p>
                <h3>Iteratively:</h3><p> After the project had been explained, I started digital sketches, getting a feel for the logo for myself.</p>
                <div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/wide1.png"></img>
                </div>
                <p>That resulted in the ones you see above.</p><p> I immediately showed them to our client, Josh and gave as feedback that he ‘didn't hate’ them but could imagine that the name ‘Pitch Playground’ on the door could be vandalised to a coarser word with a marker.
                    The name ‘Waveform Workshop’ still remained in the following iterations, but we voted on different names and eventually ‘Soundwave Studio’ came out. I did make a bit of a stylescape for the Waveform Workshop, to get the feeling I wanted to have with the logo. This was done during when it was still called 'Waveform Workshop'.</p>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/iter/images/wide2.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Designing the logo</h3>
                    <p>One of the tips I've received was just to keep designing logos one after the other. This helps me to be creative and not linger as long on one design. So nearly all of these shown below were created in rather quick succession, unless specified in the caption. </p>
                    <div id="image-slider">

                <p>The entire <a href="../../projects/group/soundwave/brandguide/brandguide.html">brandguide</a> was made by me, based on the style we as a group chose based on feedback and surveys. It was important for me to remain consistent with the design within the brandguide. The look is very dark, with purple accents. That gives it a sort of ‘fancy night time’ look.</p>
                <h3>Professional software:</h3>

                </div><p>I have been an Affinity user for at least 7 years, this is professional software similar to the Adobe suite, but a one-time purchase and a better user experience. These logos are mostly created in Affinity Designer, the counterpart to Illustrator. Vector software is better for logos because they can be scaled infinitely.
                    The brand guide was created in Affinity Publisher, the counterpart to InDesign.
                    </p>
                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>I’ve learned a lot on how to iterate what to take in. Some things didn’t go as planned at first, such as making the stylescape. But I also learned how to put all of my designs into Figma and the importance of just making and refining designs quickly. This allowed me to come up with so much more than if I had just focused on one design.</p>
                <h1>Fontys OVP</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><div class="sideimage" style="float: right;">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/side1.png"></img>
                </div><p> It was important for the Fontys OVP website redesign that I iterated on the design based on feedback and testing.</p>
                <p>For the Fontys OVP site I've made mockups of potential advertising as well as a mockup for the easter egg. I've also made a few different versions of the logo and the site design. I've also made a few different versions of the background and the UI.</p>


                <h3>Design visual works:</h3><p> We studied the Fontys brand guide and I’ve made Instagram post mockups for attracting potential students. The use of triangles is encouraged in the branding. And I’ve also paid careful attention to the colours and fonts. </p>

                <p>The Figma file was created by Louis and so we’ve used it as a starting point of our finalized design. The website was divided in sections in which each of us programmed made a different part of the main page. I made the basic layout as well as the easter egg and some of the middle parts.</p>
                <div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/side2.png"></img>
                </div><p>
                Feedback we've received after the final presentation from <i>Anke</i> and our stakeholder was also about the fold out text seen above. Originally the text was one different pages, but from testing and feedback we've received we've decided to put it in drop downs. However eventually this should've been more legible, formatted to the left and with different fonts. I did decide to make a mockup for it but the project was already finished sadly.</p>
                <p>
                This was refined into being a fully-fledged website, a potential replacement for the OVP site as well as being a replacement for the subpages. Contained all in one. The final design differs from the Figma file, the footer is different for example. This was done based on group discussion. The Figma concept was first demonstrated to our stakeholder in the first presentation, we received plenty of feedback that we iterated on.</p>

                <div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/wide3.png"></img>
                </div>
                <p>
                From the feedback we received during the user test we did with Penny as explained in LO1, I’ve set up plans in iterating on the site:</p>
                <h3>Iteration 1:Focus on Click Reduction</h3>

                <p><i>Context:</i> We conducted user testing with Penny, who had previously tested the original website. This allowed us to compare user experience across iterations.
                Findings: Penny's initial interaction revealed a key issue: the information architecture required too many clicks to find relevant content, particularly testimonials from ex-students. These were located on the main page but lacked a clear title, leading to difficulty in discovery.</p>
                <p><i>Action:</i> Based on this feedback, we prioritized information architecture in the redesign. We restructured the content to minimize clicks needed to find key information. For example, testimonials were given a prominent section with a clear title on the homepage.</p>

                <h3>Iteration 2: Refining the Easter Egg</h3><div class="linkless"  style="float: right;">
                    <img src="/images/inte/images/animation.gif"></img>
                </div>

                <p><i>Context:</i> While Penny appreciated the easter egg (Konami code interaction), she and other testers found it challenging to discover. Their attempts involved random clicks around the website, indicating a lack of intuitive discovery methods.
                Findings: The easter egg's obscurity, while intended to be subtle, hindered its enjoyment for a broader audience.</p>
                <p><i>Action:</i> We acknowledged the value of the easter egg for the target audience but recognized the need for refinement. Future iterations will explore ways to make the easter egg more discoverable, potentially through subtle hints or alternative triggers, while maintaining a clean user experience.</p>

                <p>Thanks to the user test, I came up with an idea to add a small easter egg when pressing the Fontys logo on the top left of the page. This is one of the first areas which gets clicked on so to me it made sense to add a nod to the Konami code.
                Now the player character from Contra walks past. Contra was the game the Konami code originated from.</p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> This took quite a bit of work but was rewarding. Iterating on the design made for a better end product.</p>

                <h1>Portfolio</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p>  My portfolio has seen many different iterations. Starting from learning how to use Javascript better and making a few experiments for my site design, then receiving feedback and starting again but this time instead of beginning with programming an developing the design from there, I collected inspiration.</p>
                <h3>Professional design tools:</h3><p> For my document I’ve used Affinity Publisher to create a custom layout and design. This allows me to do much more than I would’ve been able in Word. One part of the document is more of a mood board while other parts are more focused on text, but the text is able to be placed anywhere. </p>
                <h3>Iteratively: </h3><div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/wide4.png"></img>
                </div><p>
                <b>Design:</b> The design of the portfolio has seen many differences. I originally wanted to use a more 2000’s Flash inspired website. But I received harsh feedback about the design. So I started thinking and iterating on new designs, which I’ve showcased in a design document. The site radically changed designs and from there I kept building on it until I was satisfied about the looks. However, the way the content was presented changed even more. From the feedback I received I changed how the learning outcomes are presented: </p>
                <p>-	First version had every project I’ve worked on on one single page, the user could select an outcome and the projects relevant would be highlighted. This caused issues when having to add more explanation as multiple outcomes could be selected at the same time.</p><p>
                -	Second version changed the way learining outcomes were display into categories. Every one of the five has a different tab. Once clicked you’ll see every project and explanations about how the learning outcome was explored and used.</p>
                <p><b>Programming:</b> How I developed my website changed quite a bit. Based on the feedback received during the first portfolio review, I had scrap the current site and start over again and this time first designing and researching before actually coding. This resulted in a better manageable website but I also discussed with a few teachers whether or not to use some sort of JSON loading system. I decided on using it because it seemed better with large amounts of text, not having to touch code. However, I eventually found it to just be too much work once I wanted to change up the layout and add in images and galleries into the pages. So I went back to ‘hardcoding’ the page content into the HTML. This gave me a much better result but it did take some extra effort. I did learn how a JSON loader works and now have a better understanding of JSON file structure itself. So it wasn’t all for nothing.</p>
                <p><a href="https://hein.neocities.org/">The original portfolio can be visited here</a></p>
                <p>I also experimented with different ways to present the projects and learning outcomes</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Design visual works:</h3><p> I showed a lot of iterations in my document and a lot of them have an explanation next to them as to why I chose the colours that I did. But also why I went with the mashup of styles. I enjoy a lot of different designs and my challenge was to be able to combine them into a satisfying result.</p>

                <p>I documented this well into a custom PDF<p>
                <p><a href="/pdf/portfolioguide.pdf">Click here to see the PDF</a></p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> Initially I just messed around with Javascript, trying to learn new things and this quickly turned into a quite messy portfolio site. From the feedback I received in the first portfolio review I knew that I had to do it differently from now on. So instead of coding and then finding a suitable design, I would now do research and iterate on my designs. This helped me a lot in finding the right direction in which I wanted to take my portfolio.</p>

                <h1>Challenge</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p> I’ve iterated on my Subshootica project a lot. Subshootica started as a challenge from a lesson by Maikel to animate elements on a page with CSS. From that challenge, I started working on a game that can be played in the browser.</p>
                <div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/wide8.png"></img>
                </div>
                <p>In terms of using appropriate software for this project, I have used Aseprite next to Affinity Photoshop. Aseprite is a semi-professional pixel art software that I've been using for a few years now. And using my iPad as a drawing tablet allows me to have fine control. Aseprite is more suited for creating Gameboy style graphics than Affinity Photo because it is made with pixel art in mind.</p>
                <div class="wideimage">
                    <img src="/images/iter/images/wide6.png"></img>
                </div>
                <h3>Iterations:</h3><p> Thanks to the feedback I've received from my peers I've been able to iterate on the design of the game. I've made a few different versions of the main character and the enemies. I've also made a few different versions of the background and the UI.</p>
                <p>Seen in the image above, the original designs for enemies were rough. I've received a list of feedback from Maikel after I've shown him the game when it was in its first Gameboy stages. He noted that he was confused in the enemies, which ones were the 'baddies' and 'good guys'. Should the mines be hit or not? Because of that I've tweaked the designs. But I've also made a story explaining the the squids are the enemies.</p>
                
                <p>The design of the game evolved through an iterative process based on valuable feedback from peers.  This included exploring variations of the main character's design, experimenting with different enemy types, and refining the background and user interface elements. In person feedback I received generally had to do with confusion in the enemy designs and the lack of lives or powerups.</p>
                <h1>Project X: Find 'n Learn</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p> I focused a lot on iterating during this project, from the way the interviews were structured, to the designs in Figma. All based on testing and feedback.</p>
                <h3>Iteratively:</h3><p> I wanted to keep everything neatly organised in a Word document. But I also wanted to show my process which means I’ve kept the iterations and displayed them chronologically. </p>
                <h3>Interview students:</h3><p> When I made the initial interview questions, I brainstormed but I often had to guess what a student might answer. I mainly draw my inspiration from myself in that case, ‘how would I respond’. But during the first interview I already noticed how the answers were totally different than what I was anticipating. This meant I had to change my questions through conducting the interview. Important was to write them down so I can use those as a basis for the next interviews.</p>
                <h3>Interview teachers:</h3><p> The same was true for interviewing teachers, except I had to think like a teacher to create the questions. These surprisingly didn’t change as much as the student questions though. But during the process I did add a few new questions that came up naturally during the interview. I got helpful feedback during the first teacher interview and that inspired me to also conduct a survey, to gather more concrete data.</p><p>
                During the second interview I recorded the conversation and transcribed it afterwards instead of taking notes during the interview. This helped the flow of the interview.</p>
                <p><a href="/pdf/ProjectX.pdf">The full interviews are available in my research document</a></p>

                </div>
                <h3>Professional software:</h3>
                <p> I used Sketch to create the designs for the app. This allowed me to create a clickable prototype that I could test with users. Sketch works similarly to Figma but it's optimised as a native macOS app so it's way more perfomant. That helped me work quicker. Sketch is also compatible with Figma files and Figma also allows importing Sketch projects with no issues.</p>
                <p>In LO1 I've explained in detail how the final interactive prototype was developed. In this learning outcome I'll explain how the design evolved based on feedback and testing.</p>

                <p>When I showed the first designs, I was told it looked cool but that I would guaranteed get questions about the images while testing. So I changed them into pictures of teachers. I also wanted to make it look more 3D, giving the interface more depth.
                </p>

                <p>I showed Dennis my concepts and he suggested the idea of adding in a way for people to ask questions other teachers or students could answer. So I came up with the idea of a message centre. A bit like a message board or social network. Anyone can ask a question and others can reply.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I did a user test with Louis, based on the feedback I've received from him and the observation I did, I've added more clear buttons as well as a calendar so that all teachers can be looked up, not just the ones that are available at the moment.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Based on the tests I did with Levi and Jasmin I improved the design further. Giving messages a title and name for easier recognition. I also changed the way the Teams availability is displayed, it now looking like it does in Teams itself. I also changed the way the icons look next to the messages and on the teacher's pages. Making it clearer what buttons and labels mean.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The final designs involved some refining and testing by Paul and Dennis. I've added a search field and changed around confusing buttons. For example where you end up when clicking a button. This is more for the purposes of the prototype but I noticed this was sometimes distracting from the actual testing.</p>
                <h3>Final design:</h3>
                <p>You can see the final clickable prototype on Figma, but also as the original Sketch file. Or even as a PDF (without interactivity):</p>
                <p><a href="/pdf/ProjectX.sketch">Click here to download the original Sketch file. This is the best option, because it has scrollable elements</a></p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> I've learned a lot from the feedback I've received during the project. I've iterated on the designs based on the feedback I've received from my peers and teachers. This has resulted in a better end product. But I've also learned how hard it can be to iterate on certain things when you get different feedback or tests results when testing different things.</p>
