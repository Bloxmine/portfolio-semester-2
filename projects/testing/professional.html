                    <h1>Soundwave Studio</h1>
                    <h3>Context:</h3>
                    <h3>Time management:</h3><p> During the project I worked on my tasks with enough time to spare to receive feedback. It’s important for me to finish aspects of the project before the deadline so that I can have a ‘buffer zone’ and make changes if a problem arises. This was the case with the final brand guide for Soundwave Studio as well.</p>
                    <h3>Communication with stakeholders:</h3><p> Josh was often hard to reach. But we did show our progress multiple times during the project. On the first day of the project we I had already convinced our team to sit down with Josh to learn more about what he wanted in for the design. I thought it was best to already make a few concepts and that really helped us in the early stages.  Halfway through the project I sent him an email if he would have time to sit down with us so that we could show our designs. The outcome of this was that our group now had a finalised direction and design for the project.</p>
                    <h3>Presentation skills:</h3><p> I presented the final brand guide to the client and received feedback on the project. I was able to explain the choices made in the design and the reasoning behind it. I also showed the client the logo in different contexts to show the versatility of the design.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Testing:</h3><p> They way we tested logo’s was using A/B testing, showing different logos at first, gradually refining and showing slighter differences.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Planning:</h3><p>I made a Trello board for the group to keep track of the project and to make sure that the project was finished on time. I also made a planning for myself to make sure that I was on track with my tasks.
                    [show Trello board]</p>
                    
                    <h3>Exploratory Research:</h3><p> We started off our project by <i>brainstorming</i> and writing that down into the document, coming up with names and design elements. We <i>analyzed competitors</i> in a way by collecting different designs of other sound studios and this also touched on <i>literature study.</i> I wrote down </p>
                    <h3>Reporting:</h3> We made a Word document as well as a Figma file to document and report our progress. 
                    
                    <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> Sadly the project didn’t always go so well as I had hoped, communication with both the stakeholder and my team members wasn’t the best. There was conflict about how the project should go and who should do what and when. As a result the Trello board wasn’t actively followed. I desperately wanted to show something nice in the final presentations and the brand guide wasn’t coming along so well which is why I made one entirely myself. Not everyone was motivated on the same level sadly.</p>
                    
                    <h1>Fontys OVP:</h1>
                    <h3>Context:</h3><p> Like the other projects we did, most of our group work gets collected and presented in a collaborative Word document. Some parts are highlighted and link to the relevant part of the document.</p>
                    <h3>Exploratory research:</h3><p> I’ve <i>analysed what competitors do</i> right and what is better in the Fontys site. For example how Avans differs from the Fontys site and I’ve looked at <i>best, good & bad practices</i> that those sites and Fontys incorporate. This helped in identifying issues before doing interviews or surveys because it also helped use formulate questions. I didn’t do the <i>interviews</i> with OVP students but the results we received I used to develop the implementation plan.</p>
                    
                    <p>For this project I have analysed the current website of Fontys OVP and made a list of improvements. I’ve also made some adjustments of the site based on what I see in competitors and what I think is missing or important on the site.</p><p>
                    I also did an <i>observation test</i> with the original design. For which I asked Penny to find certain hard to find information, such as what times the study was taking place at and what the costs would be. This resulted in <i>usability testing</i> with the final design, in which she redid tasks. Some were different</p>
                    
                    <h3>Planning:</h3><p> I have also made a Trello board which sadly wasn't always followed by the group. But I did my best to keep the group on track and to make sure that the project was finished on time. For the second part of the project I have taken what I’ve learned into account and set clear rules from the beginning. That helped us all to get a much better and fully finished product in the end. Instead of each of us doing one part of the project by ourselves, I intentionally </p>
                    
                    <p>I have of course documented all of the things I and our group has done for the project into a document.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Implementation plan:</h3><p> I have made a 10 step implementation plan for if the Fontys OVP advertising campaign should be launched. There's a timeline, hypothetical budget based on sources and a list of things that need to be done. The plan is well documented and was given to our stakeholder during the final research presentation. This research uses parts of the DOT framework which are explained at each step in the document.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Research easter egg:</h3><p> We started off our research by brainstorming, part of the workshop method. We came up with a bunch of easter eggs, but most lacked subtlety. They were immediately visible, which seemed to not be the right fit for a site which targets professionals. </p><p>
                    Doing some competitor analysis by looking around the internet and from personal experience, I’ve found out that the Konami code is one of the most common easter eggs on websites. [LINK TO SOURCE: https://makeitmax.design/easter-eggs/] This is because it is generally noninvasive and fun. The Matrix came to mind as being a cheeky nod to IT and how computers seemingly dictate our lives. This is all just for a bit of fun but from my research I concluded</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reporting:<h3><p> We had a few moments to showcase our progress to our stakeholders. I made a PowerPoint presentation for the first two presentations in which we showed all of our progress. Our group also had a cooperative document in which we documented our findings and research. [LINK TO DOCUMENT]</p>
                    
                    
                    <h1>Project X:</h1>
                    <h3>Context:</h3><p> My personal project ‘Find ‘n Learn’ </p>
                    <h3>Project organisation:</h3><p> Important for me was setting a clear goal and timeline. I was worried initially that the project would be too ambitious, but together with Dennis we set goals for the most important aspect of the project. Since this project isn’t focused on development, its end result will be a prototype instead of a fully coded interface. Testing and research is more important. Stemming from that, I set up a timeline in the research document that I followed thoroughly.</p>
                    <h3>Explanatory research:</h3><p> This project contained a lot of essential research. Important aspects were finding the issues students and teachers experienced in terms of information, asking questions and giving appropriate answers. </p><p>
                    I made a document in which I set up the project. It first consists of <i>literature</i> study in which I find out what information is available to students and teachers. After that there are questions to be asked which roughly followed these lines in terms of research:</p>
                    <p>•	Do people ask for questions a lot, what kind of questions are asked most often?</p>
                    <p>•	Are the issues experienced with finding correct answers?</p>
                    <p>•	But also, are there frustrations in having to ask teachers certain questions that might feel simple but require more effort?</p>
                    <p>This was the basis for the project and the basis for the first batch of <i>interviews</i>, according to the CMD methods it’s often best to interview around 5 people. It was important to make questions that would fit students and different questions of teachers, to get a different perspective. </p>
                    <p>I also conducted a <i>survey</i> from which I received some interesting answers. I printed out posters with QR codes to hang around the classroom and also spread the survey around on Teams. I expected that students would’ve had more questions about the ISSD or other student facilities. But it could be that students either rarely make use of them or it could be that they’re self explanatory. </p>
