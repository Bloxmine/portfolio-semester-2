                    <p>For professional standards I have done a lot of research and found it important to document my progress. It felt important for me to set up clear planning and communication, even though that didn't always work out. Using CMD methods such as brainstorming, testing and many others helped complete my projects. CMD methods that are used, are highlighted using italics.</p>
                    <h1>Soundwave Studio</h1>
                    <h3>Time management:</h3><p> During the project I worked on my tasks with enough time to spare to receive feedback. It’s important for me to finish aspects of the project before the deadline so that I can have a ‘buffer zone’ and make changes if a problem arises. This was the case with the final brand guide for Soundwave Studio as well.</p>
                    <h3>Communication with stakeholders:</h3><p> Josh was often hard to reach. But we did show our progress multiple times during the project. On the first day of the project we I had already convinced our team to sit down with Josh to learn more about what he wanted in for the design. I thought it was best to already make a few concepts and that really helped us in the early stages.  Halfway through the project I sent him an email if he would have time to sit down with us so that we could show our designs. The outcome of this was that our group now had a finalised direction and design for the project.</p>
                    <h3>Presentation skills:</h3><p> I presented the final brand guide to the client and received feedback on the project. I was able to explain the choices made in the design and the reasoning behind it. I also showed the client the logo in different contexts to show the versatility of the design. He did note however that he was surprised I chose bags as one of the usecases, as the Soundlab is only a small room within Fontys. I explained to him that for me it looks good to see the logo in a context that <i>could</i> be used if they decide to fully implement it.</p>

                    <h3>Planning:</h3><p>I made a Trello board to keep track of the project and to make sure that the project was finished on time. I also made a planning for myself to make sure that I was on track with my tasks. Below you can see the initial Trello I made for myself after we brainstormed. This was a good starting point for me.</p>

                    <p><b>Research question:</b></p>
                    <p><i>How can we create a branding for the Fontys soundlab which is fresh and conveys what the soundlab is about?</i></p>
                    <p>We started off our project by <i>brainstorming</i> and writing that down into the document, coming up with names and design elements. We <i>analyzed competitors</i> in a way by collecting different designs of other sound studios and this also touched on <i>literature study.</i> Important for us was that we </p>

                    <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> Sadly the project didn’t always go so well as I had hoped, communication with both the stakeholder and my team members wasn’t the best. There was conflict about how the project should go and who should do what and when. As a result the Trello board wasn’t actively followed by my peers. I desperately wanted to show something nice in the final presentations and the brand guide wasn’t coming along so well which is why I made one entirely myself. Not everyone was motivated on the same level sadly.</p>
                    
                    <h1>Fontys OVP:</h1>
                    <h3>Context:</h3><p> Like the other projects we did, most of our group work gets collected and presented in a collaborative Word document. Some parts are highlighted and link to the relevant part of the document.</p>

                    <h3>Exploratory research:</h3>
                    <p><b>Research question:</b></p>
                    <p><i>How can we improve the Fontys OVP website to make it more appealing to potential students?</i></p>
                    <p> I’ve <i>analysed what competitors do</i> right and what is better in the Fontys site. For example how Avans differs from the Fontys site and I’ve looked at <i>best, good & bad practices</i> that those sites and Fontys incorporate. This helped in identifying issues before doing interviews or surveys because it also helped use formulate questions. I didn’t do the <i>interviews</i> with OVP students but the results we received I used to develop the implementation plan.</p>
                    <p><a href="/pdf/Media campaign.pdf">Click here to see the research document</a></p>
                    <p>For this project I have analysed the current website of Fontys OVP and made a list of improvements. I’ve also made some adjustments of the site based on what I see in competitors and what I think is missing or important on the site.</p><p>
                    I also did an <i>observation test</i> with the original design. For which I asked Penny to find certain hard to find information, such as what times the study was taking place at and what the costs would be. This resulted in <i>usability testing</i> with the final design, in which she redid many of the same tasks as with the original design. This is explained more in depth in LO1.</p>
                    <h3>Planning:</h3><p> I have also made a Trello board which sadly wasn't always followed by the group. But I did my best to keep the group on track and to make sure that the project was finished on time. For the second part of the project I have taken what I’ve learned into account and set clear rules from the beginning. That helped us all to get a much better and fully finished product in the end. Instead of each of us doing one part of the project by ourselves.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation plan:</h3><p> I have made a 10 step implementation plan for if the Fontys OVP advertising campaign should be launched. There's a timeline, hypothetical budget based on sources and a list of things that need to be done. The plan is well documented and was given to our stakeholder during the final research presentation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Research easter egg:</h3><p> We started off our research by brainstorming, part of the workshop method. We came up with a bunch of easter eggs, but most lacked subtlety. They were immediately visible, which seemed to not be the right fit for a site which targets professionals. </p><p>
                    Doing some competitor analysis by looking around the internet and from personal experience, I’ve found out that the Konami code is one of the  <a href="https://makeitmax.design/easter-eggs/">most common easter eggs</a> on websites. This is because it is generally noninvasive and fun. The Matrix came to mind as being a cheeky nod to IT and how computers seemingly dictate our lives. This is all just for a bit of fun but from my research I concluded</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reporting:</h3><p> We had a few moments to showcase our progress to our stakeholders. I made a <a href="/pdf/OVP1/First.pdf">PowerPoint presentation</a> for the first presentation to our stakeholder and I've also made a <a href="/pdf/OVP1/Second.pdf">second one for the final presentation</a> of the first part of the project.

                    <h3>Context:</h3><p> My personal project ‘Find ‘n Learn’ has been documentented fully in a seperate Word document that you can read in detail. (Dutch only) However, I've explained here how these elements releate to professional standards.</p>
                    <h3>Project organisation:</h3><p> Important for me was setting a clear goal and timeline. I was worried initially that the project would be too ambitious, but together with Dennis we set goals for the most important aspect of the project. Since this project isn’t focused on development, its end result will be a prototype instead of a fully coded interface. Testing and research is more important. Stemming from that, I set up a timeline in the research document that I followed thoroughly.</p>
                    <h3>Exploratory research:</h3>
                    <p><b>Research question:</b></p>
                    <p><i>How can I improve the information flow between students and teachers at Fontys?</i></p>
                    <p> This project contained a lot of essential research. Important aspects were finding the issues students and teachers experienced in terms of information, asking questions and giving appropriate answers. </p><p>
                    Before creating the document, I've <i>brainstormed</i> with my coach, Dennis about what shape the project should take. I made a document in which I set up the project. It first consists of <i>literature</i> study in which I find out what information is available to students and teachers. After that there are questions to be asked which roughly followed these lines in terms of research:</p>
                    <p>•	Do people ask for questions a lot, what kind of questions are asked most often?</p>
                    <p>•	Are the issues experienced with finding correct answers?</p>
                    <p>•	But also, are there frustrations in having to ask teachers certain questions that might feel simple but require more effort?</p>
                    <p>This was the basis for the project and the basis for the first batch of <i>interviews</i>, according to the CMD methods it’s often best to interview around 5 people. It was important to make questions that would fit students and different questions of teachers, to get a different perspective. </p>
                    <div class="sideimage" style="float: right;">
                        <img src="/images/prof/images/side4.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <p>I also conducted a <i>survey</i> from which I received some interesting answers. I printed out posters with QR codes to hang around the classroom and also spread the survey around on Teams. I expected that students would’ve had more questions about the ISSD or other student facilities. But it could be that students either rarely make use of them or it could be that they’re self explanatory. </p>

                </p>
                <p><i>Testing</i> was also an important part of my project. I did multiple tests with other students and asked them to <i>think aloud</i> because this helped me identify issues that might otherwise be overlooked because I wouldn't ask them directly. This also involved them in the creation process of the project, they've become <i>co-creators</i> in a sense. This helped me develop my <i>prototypes</i> further. I also did a <i>usability test</i> with the final design, in which I asked students to find certain information. This is explained more in depth in LO1.</p>
                <h3>Reporting:</h3><p>
                    I have made a Word document in which I documented all of my research and findings. In that document I've also made clear when I was going to talk with my coach about the project. I sat with Dennis on every monday and tuesday to discuss the project and to get feedback. And when required I also reached out to him on Teams. This process helped me set clear goals which gave me a better understanding of what I wanted to achieve with the project. </p>
