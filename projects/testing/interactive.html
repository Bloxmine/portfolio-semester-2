                <p>This semester, I've learned the importance of staying informed about current trends in design and interactive media.  Experimenting with interactive elements in my projects has been a rewarding challenge, allowing me to explore new ways of engaging users with the brand identity. Not every project has been able to get to the same level of interactivity but we each had our own tasks.</p>
                <h1>Soundwave Studio</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p>The sound lab redesign project is no small task, it involves quite a bit of research but finding how interactive design fits into the project can be difficult.</p>
                <h3>Orientation and Research:</h3><p>  In line with the Soundwave Studio project, I conducted research on current trends in logo design, particularly focusing on styles prevalent within the radio and audio studio landscape. </p>
                <h3>Orient:</h3><div class="linkless"  style="float: right;">
                    <img src="/images/inte/images/bag.png"></img>
                </div><p> I had never really used Figma before and this proved to be a helpful technology to iterate but also collaboratively design and brainstorm. I mostly like using vector based design tools but with this project I’ve also dabbled in using effects (like light textures, sunshine etc), stock photography (for backgrounds) and 3D assets. Those 3D assets were something I definitely wanted to try out using Adobe Dimension, to create mockups for products in the brand guide</p>
                
                <h3>Interactive Media Products:</h3><p>  Due to the nature of a brandguide, the process for designing it is a bit different from normal interactive products. It was mainly made in Affinity Publisher. It’s something that should be printed out so interactivity is hard to incorporate.</p>
                
                <h3>Testing:</h3><p> The logos were tested by way of surveys for gathering feedback. Two others from our group conducted multiple surveys by walking through the classroom and having students choose. 
                Voting was done by around 30 media students. From the results we chose two logos, neither being made by me.</p>
                 
                <h3>Reflection:</h3><p> This project was more about creating proof of concepts than creating actual interactive prototypes. The brandguide sadly was not able to be made interactive, due to the printable nature of the product. However, other parts of the learning outcome did have a place in our project.</p>             
                <h1>Fontys OVP</h1>
                <p>Context: This project was all about interactivity, our group needed to create an interactive result that will be intriguing to users.</p>
                    <h3>Personas:</h3><div class="contentimage" style="float: right;">
                        <a href="/projects/group/soundwave/personas/personas.html">
                            <img src="/images/inte/images/project2.jpg"></img>
                        </a>
                    </div><p>Based on <a href="/pdf/Media campaign.pdf">research done by one of our group members, Loes</a> I have developed two different personas that fit with the goal of our project. These two personas differ from each other in terms of age, background, and goals. This is great for getting a feel for the kind of people that are attracted to this study and how we can incorporate them into the redesign of the website.</p>
                    <p>
                    The redesigned OVP site uses interactivity in the form of easter eggs, in this case a rather nerdy one. Seeing as the site has ‘professionals’ as a target audience, an ‘in your face’ easter egg seems out of place. Instead, when inputting the Konami code, the site is ‘matrixified’. 
                    The Konami code is one easter egg that’s often used in websites because it’s both unobtrusive and fun for people who know to look for it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Personas and Interactivity:</h3><p>Based on our preliminary research and the development of user personas, we identified a target audience that might appreciate subtle, nerdy easter eggs. This informed the decision to include the Konami code as a form of unobtrusive interactivity.</p>
                    <div class="sideimage" style="float: right;">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Figma:</h3><p>I used the Figma created by Louis as a basis for the website’s design.<p><a href="/pdf/OVPFigma.pdf">Click here to see the Figma file</a></p><p> was a nice basis and helped me to set a goal to work towards.
                        </p>
                    <h3>User testing:</h3>
                    <b>Penny:</b><p> The final programmed website has been tested by Penny, who also tested the original website as part of an observation. The results of that observation have been taken into account while designing the new site. For example, the number of clicks needed to find relevant information has been reduced.</p>
                    <h3>Observation original site:</h3>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/sides/side4.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <i>She had trouble finding when the study starts but also what times the students had lessons. Something that could be important for people who are already working.</i>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/sides/side5.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <i>This proved nearly impossible to find concretely. The costs use a calculation system, but she also had trouble finding that. Clicking around and scrolling down eventually led her to a section where it was explained in small print that you had to use the cost calculator. And from there it was still a few click away.</i>
                    
                    <h3>Testing our (near) finished site:</h3>
                    
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/sides/side1.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <i>One of the first things she did was click on the Fontys logo, but nothing happened. Clicking on nearly every element before pressing keys. Something did happen when pressing the ‘up arrow’ key but it was too vague to know what to do next.</i>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/sides/side2.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <i>Scrolling down, but due to the wording she had trouble finding the testimonials. They were named with a slightly more attractive ‘alumni aan het woord’ but didn’t clearly tell that they were testimonials until you’d start reading.</i>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/sides/side3.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <i>This one was easier, first instinct is to scroll down to the footer and the relevant info was indeed visible, but we noted that she also looked at the header and found the contact button there in ‘over fontys’ and then ‘contact’</i>
                    <p>Our most important finding was that she noted that it’s good that information is found in multiple places but that wording of some areas were too vague. For example, we asked her to find testimonials of ex-students. Those are located on the main page, but due to it not having a clear title, she had difficulty in finding them. With the easter egg, she and many others noted that it might be too difficult to find for the average person. We noticed in testing that she and others start clicking around on the page to try to find the easter egg. This resulted in creating an additional easter egg which can be found by clicking on the logo. This is explained more in detail in the Iterative Design section.</p>
                    <b>Others:</b><p> We also tested the easter egg with Yvonne, Anke and Paul during our ‘market presentation’. They all had trouble finding the easter egg. And that shows how hard it can be to test an easter egg. </p>

                    
                    
                    <h3>Interactive Prototype:</h3><div class="linkless"  style="float: right;">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/animation.gif"></img>
                    </div><p>The redesigned Fontys ICT for Professionals site incorporates an interactive easter egg triggered by entering the Konami code. Upon successful input, the site undergoes a "matrixification" effect, where the visual elements are changed to look like the user steps into the Matrix, with everything becoming green on black with cascading text.</p>
                    <div class="wideimage">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/wide3.png"></img>
                    </div>
                        <h3>Relevant tech media and design landscape:</h3><p> The incorporation of an easter egg into a site is done on a lot of websites. Especially the Konami code is a timeless trend for websites to incorporate, as seen on a <a href="https://www.designer-websites.co.uk/blog/post/our-top-8-website-easter-eggs">lot of lists</a> We used a clean and modern design with big images that you often see in websites to grab users’ attention.</p>
                        <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>
                        This was a fun project. Trying to come up with way to improve the website, testing those improvements and refining was challenging but rewarding. Creating the easter egg was a lot of fun and during this project I’ve definitely learned how we can effectively work together. Being a group of three during the development phase brought with it some challenges. Merge conflicts were one thing, but also maintaining a clear project set up was difficult. We each had different ways of coding and especially parts like the CSS file used a bunch of different layouts. We did however make it clear from the beginning that we should use variables. This meant that we didn’t have multiple shades of purple or pixel heights for the same things. That made working together a lot better.</p><p>
                        
                        During the research part, I was in a different team. There sadly was a general lack of motivation among my teammates and one of them quit after that part of the project was finished, leaving with half finished work. If I were to start over again with this part, I would put more focus towards organisation and setting clear rules.</p>
                        <h1>Portfolio:</h1>
                        <h3>Context:</h3><p> My portfolio was a constantly changing project which involved research, testing and learning to code new things I hadn’t made before.</p>
                        <h3>Orient:</h3><p> I asked around a lot during the development to find out cool new techniques and technologies to incorporate into my website. For example, figuring out how Three.js worked and how I could incorporate it into my website was a must.</p>
                        <h3>Relevant tech, media and design landscape:</h3>
                        <div class="wideimage">
                            <img src="/images/inte/images/wide1.png"></img>
                        </div><div class="sideimage" style="float: right;">
                            <a href="/pdf/portfolioguide.pdf">
                                <img src="/images/inte/images/side1.png"></img>
                            </a>
                        </div><p> I have made a design document for my portfolio in which I collect and explain my inspiration. My portfolio follows a quite an unconventional design compared to many modern websites. I’ve always been a big Star Trek fan and I especially appreciate the LCARS interface used in multiple series. At the same time, I didn’t want to totally revolve my site around Star Trek so the design has been simplified and I’ve added in a few more influences.</p><p>
                        I enjoy classic web design, when the web was just a collection of personal pages, totally customised to the webmaster’s liking. My portfolio has that influence intertwined with its core design.</p>
                        <h3>Inspiration from relevant tech, media and design landscape:</h3>
                        <div class="wideimage">
                            <img src="/images/inte/images/wide2.png"></img>
                        </div>
                        <p>I wanted to have a 3D element on my page and a rotating earth seemd like a great fit for the Star Trek inspired interface. I've also taken inspiration from interfaces such as the <i>Wii Forecast Channel</i> and the <i>Mario Kart 7</i> online globe. These have a very bumpy texture to them and on the forecast channel the user can pan the earth by pointing and dragging, something I've added to my earth model as well.</p>
                        <h2>Testing:</h2><p> I felt it was necessary to test out my portfolio multiple times during its development. This would ensure that it was easy to navigate and find relevant information for the learning outcomes. The iteration process is explained in full detail in LO3, but the test setups are explained here.</p><div class="sideimage" style="float: right;">
                            <img src="/images/inte/images/side2.png"></img>
                        </div><p>
                        I’ve heard a lot of feedback about the legibility of the content on the site. It’s white on black and in a narrow window by default. Which is why I added a lightmode toggle button as well as a button to expand the view.</p>
                        <p>
                        Once expanded the button turns into a versatile ‘back button’ and once the lightmode button is pressed it shows a crescent moon, to signify that the button can be pressed again to return the view to normal.</p>
                        <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>
                            With my portfolio I’ve managed to take inspiration from a wide variety of sources. And that made it into a great looking website in my opinion.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Project X:</h1>
                        <h3>Context:</h3><p> For my personal project ‘Find ‘n Learn’ I've made quite a few interactive prototypes to test out new interfaces, the iterations of them are located in LO3 but the finished products are shown here.</p>
