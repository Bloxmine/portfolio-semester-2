                <p>Overal reflection: This semester, I've learned the importance of staying informed about current trends in design and interactive media.  Experimenting with interactive elements in my projects has been a rewarding challenge, allowing me to explore new ways of engaging users with the brand identity. Not every project has been able to get to the same level of interactivity but we each had our own tasks.</p>
                <h1>Soundwave Studio</h1>
                <h3>Context:</h3><p>The soundlab redesign project is no small task, it involves quite a bit of research but finding how interactive design fits into the project can be difficult.
                    Orientation and Research:  In line with the Soundwave Studio project, I conducted research on current trends in logo design, particularly focusing on styles prevalent within the radio and audio studio landscape. </p>
                <h1>Fontys OVP</h1>
                <p>Context: This project was all about interactivity, our group needed to create an interactive result that will be intriguing to users.</p>
                    <h3>Personas:</h3><div class="contentimage"  style="float: right;">
                        <img src="/images/inte/images/project2.jpg"></img>
                    </div><p>Based on preliminary research we have done as a group, I have developed two different personas that fit with the goal of our project. These two personas differ from each other in terms of age, background, and goals. This is great for getting a feel for the kind of people that are attracted to this study and how we can incorporate them into the redesign of the website.</p>
                    <p>
                    The redesigned OVP site uses interactivity in the form of easter eggs, in this case a rather nerdy one. Seeing as the site has ‘professionals’ as a target audience, an ‘in your face’ easter egg seems out of place. Instead, when inputting the Konami code, the site is ‘matrixified’. 
                    The Konami code is one easter egg that’s often used in websites because it’s both unobtrusive and fun for people who know to look for it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Personas and Interactivity:</h3><p>Based on our preliminary research and the development of user personas, we identified a target audience that might appreciate subtle, nerdy easter eggs. This informed the decision to include the Konami code as a form of unobtrusive interactivity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Figma:</h3><p> I used the Figma created by Louis as a basis for the website’s design.
                    [link to Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/fYWNeY0iyvJSwSCjAQ3nBR/Fontys-ICT-deeltijd-websiite?node-id=0-1&t=Xk8zCPgHgxlgfUKB-0]</p>
                    
                    <h3>User testing:</h3><p>
                    Penny: The final programmed website has been tested by Penny, who also tested the original website as part of an observation. The results of that observation have been taken into account while designing the new site. For example, the number of clicks needed to find relevant information has been reduced.
                    The observation of the original site consisted of 
                    [TEST RESULTS OF 2024-05-23 HERE]
                    Our most important finding was that she noted that it’s good that information is found in multiple places but that wording of some areas were too vague. For example, we asked her to find testimonials of ex-students. Those are located on the main page, but due to it not having a clear title, she had difficulty in finding them. With the easter egg, she and many others noted that it might be too difficult to find for the average person. We noticed in testing that she and others start clicking around on the page to try to find the easter egg. This resulted in creating an additional easter egg for 
                    Others: We also tested the easter egg with Yvonne, Anke and Paul during our ‘market presentation’. They all had trouble finding the easter egg. And that shows how hard it can be to test an easter egg.hjjh</p>
                    
                    <h3>Interactive Prototype:</h3><p>The redesigned Fontys ICT for Professionals site incorporates an interactive easter egg triggered by entering the Konami code. Upon successful input, the site undergoes a "matrixification" effect, where the visual elements are changed to look like the user steps into the Matrix, with everything becoming green on black with cascading text.</p>
                    Relevant tech media and design landscape: The incorporation of an easter egg into the site is different
                    Reflection:
                    This was a fun project. Trying to come up with way to improve the website, testing those improvements and refining was challenging but rewarding. Creating the easter egg was a lot of fun and during this project I’ve definitely learned how we can effectively work together. Being a group of three during the development phase brought with it some challenges. Merge conflicts were one thing, but also maintaining a clear project set up was difficult. We each had different ways of coding and especially parts like the CSS file used a bunch of different layouts. We did however make it clear from the beginning that we should use variables. This meant that we didn’t have multiple shades of purple or pixel heights for the same things. That made working together a lot better.
                    
                    During the research part, I was in a different team. There sadly was a general lack of motivation among my teammates and one of them quit after that part of the project was finished, leaving with half finished work. If I were to start over again with this part, I would put more focus towards organisation and setting clear rules.
                    Including the Konami code easter egg was a way to cater to a potential segment of the target audience who might appreciate a subtle, nerdy reference. While maintaining a professional tone for the site overall, this unobtrusive interactive element adds a touch of fun to a project that doesn’t necessarily has ‘being fun’ as a target.
