            "projectcontent": "I feel it is difficult to decide which direction I would like to take in Media. I often hear from teachers that the development side suits me well, but I really enjoy designing. I think it would be best to find something that combines these things. During this semester I have been busy asking for feedback on my projects and then of course processing it. This is all described in detail in the previous learning outcomes. I didn’t have much trouble with asking for feedback, I have however changed my outlook on feedback from ‘this is how it should be done’ to ‘this is how it can be done’ when receiving feedback. Every teacher gives different feedback and I’ve found a balance between taking feedback literally and using it as a starting point.\n\nI definitely feel like I’ve grown a lot this semester, I’ve asked for feedback even more than before and learned a lot of things about Media which I’ve never heard of before. I enjoy talking with others, teachers and students alike, about interesting things in the Media landscape, and this inspires me to create more interesting things.\n\nI will admit that I sometimes still feel a bit out of place. That’s not as much an issue with Fontys as it is an issue with how I personally feel like I’d like to learn. But I have found a greater affinity for coding. I had thought I would’ve gravitated towards design a lot more, since that’s the field I’m coming from.\n\nIf I were to choose right now, I would like to go in a direction which involves making interactive projects. Most likely on the web but my other interests like designing and working with new tech are preferably incorporated as well."

            "projectcontent": "On the 18th of April I went to the Career Day on Strijp-TQ. My goal was to learn more aout what minors were able to be chosen and which fit me as a Media student. I also wanted to see which companies had stands and what they were looking for in a student. Sadly, most of them focused on the largest groups of students, in the fields of software and infrastructure. For me this seemed a bit concerning, but I know that you of course can’t have every company here and most are still looking for media related employees, but they hadn’t thought of it at that moment.\n\nSome of the minors that were showcased do interest me but I feel like that’s something that I should revisit next time I go to the career day, because I am planning to visit again. Right now to me it seems a little early because I still haven’t totally figured out which direction I want to follow in media itself."
