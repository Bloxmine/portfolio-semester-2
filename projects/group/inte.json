    "description": "Overal reflection: This semester, I've learned the importance of staying informed about current trends in design and interactive media.  Experimenting with interactive elements in my projects has been a rewarding challenge, allowing me to explore new ways of engaging users with the brand identity. Not every project has been able to get to the same level of interactivity but we each had our own tasks.",

I’ve also made proof of concepts for the brandguide. And the entire brandguide itself \n\n **Orientation and Research**:  In line with the Soundwave Studio project, I conducted research on current trends in logo design, particularly focusing on styles prevalent within the radio and audio studio landscape. Additionally, I explored interactive media trends in music streaming platforms and music website design to gain insights into how user engagement could be fostered within the brand identity. \n\n**Interactive Media Product**:  Due to the nature of a brandguide, the process for designing it is a bit different from normal interactive products. It was mainly made in Affinity Publisher. It’s something that should be printed out so interactivity is hard to incorporate. \n\n **Testing**: The prototype was then tested with // to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness in conveying the brand identity. \n\n**Reflection**: \n\n**Click on the image to see the brandguide**"

            "projectcontent": "**Personas**: Based on preliminary research I have developed two different personas that fit with the goal of our project. These two personas differ from each other in terms of age, background, and goals. This is great for getting a feel for the kind of people that are attracted to this study and how we can incorporate them into the redesign of the website. \n\nThe redesigned OVP site uses interactivity in the form of easter eggs, in this case a rather nerdy one. Seeing as the site has ‘professionals’ as a target audience, an ‘in your face’ easter egg seems out of place. Instead, when inputting the Konami code, the site is ‘matrixified’. The Konami code is one easter egg that’s often used in websites because it’s both unobtrusive and fun for people who know to look for it. \n\n**Personas and Interactivity**: Based on our preliminary research and the development of user personas, we identified a target audience that might appreciate subtle, nerdy easter eggs. This informed the decision to include the Konami code as a form of unobtrusive interactivity. \n\n **Interactive Prototype**: The redesigned Fontys ICT for Professionals site incorporates an interactive easter egg triggered by entering the Konami code. Upon successful input, the site undergoes a 'matrixification' effect, where the visual elements are changed to look like the user steps into the Matrix, with everything becoming green on black with cascading text. \n\n **Reflection**: Including the Konami code easter egg was a way to cater to a potential segment of the target audience who might appreciate a subtle, nerdy reference. While maintaining a professional tone for the site overall, this unobtrusive interactive element adds a touch of fun to a project that doesn’t necessarily has ‘being fun’ as a target."

Including observing how people play and experience the gameplay loop. \n\nI have made adjustments and retested my game often and iterated on it thanks to the [feedback I’ve received.](projects/group/soundwave/feedback/feedback.html) \n\n **Click on the image to play the game**"
