            "projectcontent": "**Design** With the Soundwave Studio design process I’ve started with creating digital sketches of initial logo designs, the name and font and colour choice. I continued with a mood board to get a feel of where the design should be moving towards. This is also influenced by feedback I’ve received from our client as well as fellow students. We had our target audience decide on which logo has the best look and feel. Two of them won and we combined them into one, each group member creating a refined version of the logo. Mine was the final chosen logo after a second round of polling. I used this logo to iteratively build the design of the entire brand guide.\n\n_Professional software_: I've been a Photoshop and other Adobe software user for many years but my preferred software suite to work with is Affinity. I've been using it a lot for the past 7 or so years and the [logos and brand guide](projects/group/soundwave/brandguide/brandguide.html) were made by me in Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher. \n\n In the brand guide there are explinations for colour and font choices, as well as common design rules such as placement and do's and don'ts.\n\n**Click on the image to see a gallery of the iterations and some explinations**"

            "projectcontent": "Subshootica started as a challenge from a lesson by Maikel to animate elements on a page with CSS. From that challenge, I started working on a game that can be played in the browser [intial screenshot here].\n\n The design of the game evolved through an iterative process based on valuable feedback from peers.  This included exploring variations of the main character's design, experimenting with different enemy types, and refining the background and user interface elements. In person feedback I received generally had to do with confusion in the enemy designs and the lack of lives or powerups. [powerups en enemies hier] \n\n In terms of using appropriate software for this projects, I have used Aseprite next to Affinity Photoshop. Aseprite is a semi-professional pixel art software that I've been using for a few years now. And using my iPad as a drawing tablet allows me to have fine control. Aseprite is more suited for creating _Gameboy_ style graphics than Affinity Photo because it is made with pixel art in mind. \n\n_Iterations_: Thanks to the feedback I've received from my peers I've been able to iterate on the design of the game. I've made a few different versions of the main character and the enemies. I've also made a few different versions of the background and the UI. \n\n**Click on the image to see a gallery of the iterations and some explinations**"
