I continued with a mood board to get a feel of where the design should be moving towards. This is also influenced by feedback I’ve received from our client as well as fellow students. We had our target audience decide on which logo has the best look and feel. Two of them won and we combined them into one, each group member creating a refined version of the logo. Mine was the final chosen logo after a second round of polling. I used this logo to iteratively build the design of the entire brand guide."
