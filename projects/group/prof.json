With the feedback received I continued to refine the name and design. As a group we asked feedback on our created logos later in the project and I took the. \n\n_Time management_: During the project I worked on my tasks with enough time to spare to receive feedback. It’s important for me to finish aspects of the project before the deadline so that I can have a ‘buffer zone’ and make changes if a problem arises. This was the case with the final brand guide for Soundwave Studio as well.\n\n_Presentation skills_: I presented the final brand guide to the client and received feedback on the project. I was able to explain the choices made in the design and the reasoning behind it. I also showed the client the logo in different contexts to show the versatility of the design. \n\n_Planning_: I made a Trello board for the group to keep track of the project and to make sure that the project was finished on time. I also made a planning for myself to make sure that I was on track with my tasks."

I’ve also made some adjustments of the site based on what I see in competitors and what I think is missing or important on the site. \n\n_Planning_ I have also made a [Trello board](images/trello.png) which sadly wasn't always followed by the group. But I did my best to keep the group on track and to make sure that the project was finished on time. \n\n I have of course documented all of the things I and our group has done for the project into a document. \n\n_Implementation plan_: I have made a 10 step implementation plan for if the Fontys OVP advertising campaign should be launched. There's a timeline, hypothetical budget based on sources and a list of things that need to be done. The plan is well documented and was given to our stakeholder during the presentation. This research uses parts of the DOT framework.\n\n **Click on the image to see the documentation including the implementation plan**"

This allows me to get different point of view about how my development is moving along. \n\nThe feedback I receive helps me identify my own core values by hearing how others see my work instead of thinking something is ‘finished’ and not looking at it again."
