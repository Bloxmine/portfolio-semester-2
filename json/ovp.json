    "pagecontent": "Immediately after the project introduction I made a few concept logos, as sketches and to get a feel of our project. I discussed with our stakeholder about what direction to go and what he thought about the logos and the names I came up with, this way we could continue with collecting data. With our survey, we let our target audience, the Media students, choose which of our logos has the best look and feel. Mine didn't win, but with the data we collected we selected a few winners, combined them, did another survey and my improved logo was chosen. While my fellow project members worked on other things, I worked on the brand guide. I made it from scratch, choosing fonts, colours and guidelines. I made a few iterations and discussed them with my team and our stakeholder. I made sure that the brand guide was professional and that it was clear what the brand was about"
